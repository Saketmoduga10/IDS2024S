19. Switching and amplifying electrical signals to perform calculations.
20. Heat and power issues
21. Fetch, decode, execute
22. Yes. This is because of memory access delays or poor efficiency in managing resources.
23. Memory access because the speed of memory access is much slower compared to CPU operations.
24. Dennard Scaling: As transistors get smaller, power density stays constant. MOSFET Scaling: Describes how MOSFET transistors are made smaller for better performance. Mooreâ€™s Law: The number of transistors on a chip doubles approximately every two years.

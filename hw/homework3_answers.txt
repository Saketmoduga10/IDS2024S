1. Three Pillars of Science**: Theory, Experiment, and Computation.

2. Applications of Computational and Data Sciences:
   - Weather Forecasting**: Predicting weather patterns.
   - Bioinformatics**: Analyzing biological data.
   - Financial Modeling**: Predicting stock market trends.

3. Two Types of Scientific Reasoning**: Inductive and Deductive.

4. Difference between Observational Data and Reality: Observational data are measurements or evidence gathered, while reality is the actual state of the world.

5. Three Stages of Scientific Inference in Prediction Pyramid**: Data, Model, Prediction.

6. Logical Proposition: A statement that can be either true or false.

7. Can a Logical Proposition be Both True and False? No, in deductive reasoning, a logical proposition cannot be both true and false simultaneously.

8. Does A⇒B Necessitate B⇒A?** No. Example: "If it rains, the ground is wet" (A⇒B), but "The ground is wet" does not mean "it rained" (B⇒A) because there could be other reasons for the wet ground.

9. Venn Diagram for A+B (Logical Sum/Disjunction)**: The combined area of both circles A and B, including any overlap.

10. Venn Diagram for A⋅B (Logical Product/Conjunction)**: The overlapping area of circles A and B.

11. Venn Diagram for A⇒B: The area where A is inside or overlapping with B, showing that if A is true, B must also be true.

12. Logical Implication Does Not Imply Physical Causation**: Example: "If there is smoke, there is fire." However, fire does not cause smoke every time (e.g., smoke machines).

13. Policeman, Jewelry, and Burglar**: This suggests that the presence of a policeman, jewelry, and a burglar does not necessarily imply the policeman caused the burglary.

14. Tiniest Unit of Information**: 
    - a. Bit.
    - b. It represents the tiniest unit because it can hold two possible values: 0 or 1.
    - **Coordinate in Empty Space**: You need a reference point to determine coordinates or speed.
    - c. 
      1. 1 Box: 2 things.
      2. 2 Boxes: 4 things.
      3. 3 Boxes: 8 things.

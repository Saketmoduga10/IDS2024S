2. Non-negativity, Normalization, Additivity
3. Aesthetics are visual properties used to represent data, like size, color, or shape.
4. Positional Aesthetics: e.g., x and y coordinates.
Non-positional Aesthetics: e.g., color, size, shape.
5. Quantitative: Numerical data (e.g., age, income).
Qualitative: Categorical data (e.g., gender, favorite color).
6. Categorical variables.
7. Ordered: Age groups (child, teen, adult), rankings.
Unordered: Colors (red, blue, green), names.
8. **Month**
Qualitative
Categorical
Discrete
Ordered (Months have a natural order, e.g., Jan, Feb, etc.)

**Day**
Quantitative
Numerical
Discrete
Ordered (Days are sequential)

**Location**
Qualitative
Categorical
Discrete
Unordered (Locations don't have an inherent order)

**Station ID**
Qualitative
Categorical
Discrete
Unordered (Station IDs are identifiers without order)

**Temperature**
Quantitative
Numerical
Continuous
Ordered (Temperatures can be ranked or compared numerically)

9. Axes should use the same units and grid size when the data involves spatial relationships, like maps or geometric shapes, to ensure accurate proportions and avoid distortion.
10. Example: Plotting the dimensions of a rectangle or visualizing the coordinates of points in a 2D plane.
11. The black grid.
12. Sequential: Smoothly changing colors (e.g., light to dark).
Usage: For ordered, continuous data like temperature or elevation.

Diverging: Two contrasting colors meeting at a midpoint.
Usage: For data with a meaningful center, like profit/loss.

Categorical: Distinct colors for separate categories.
Usage: For unordered, qualitative data like regions or teams.

Perceptually Uniform: Colors change evenly in perceived intensity.
Usage: For accurate representation of data gradients in heatmaps.

13. Negative Ages: Having negative values for "age" is just weird – age can’t be negative, so it makes the plot confusing.

Weird Smoothness: The curve is too smooth, and it ends up looking unnatural with odd dips and peaks that don’t really represent the data well.

Off-Center Axes: The x-axis doesn’t start at zero, which makes it look sloppy and less intuitive.

Plain Color: The blue color is fine, but it doesn’t really make the graph pop or add any flair, so it feels kind of flat.

16. Classical, Frequentist, Bayesian, Subjectivist
17. 2 animals - Frog and horse
18. Pick a stick from the first number 8 such that it transforms to form number 9 and put that in the number of RHS such that it becomes 8.

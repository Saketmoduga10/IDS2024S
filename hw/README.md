     1. Non-negativity: P(A) ≥ 0 for any event A. This means that the probability of an event cannot be negative.
     2. Normalization: P(Ω) = 1. This is where Ω is the sample space (the set of all possible outcomes). This make sures  that the probability of the entire sample space is 1.
     3. Additivity: This means that the probability of the union of mutually exclusive events equals the sum of their individual probabilities.

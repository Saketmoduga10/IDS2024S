Regression: Predicting the global land temperature of Earth in 2050 from the past data: Choosing the best model - 

4. The quadratic (polynomial of degree two) regression model appears to provide a better representation of reality when compared to the linear regression model. This is because the quadratic model accounts for the accelerated increase in temperature anomalies observed in recent years, which a simple linear model cannot capture effectively. Regarding temperature predictions for the near future, the quadratic model predicts a more rapid increase in temperature anomalies compared to the linear model, reflecting the trend of accelerating climate change.








Online experimentation with DBSCAN clustering technique - 

1. The two free parameters of DBSCAN are:

Epsilon (ε): The maximum distance between two points to be considered neighbors.
MinPoints: The minimum number of points required to form a dense region.

2. For all points in a single cluster:

Example parameters: Epsilon = 2.0, MinPoints = 2
Not unique: Another example is Epsilon = 3.0, MinPoints = 2

3. For at least one outlier (noise point):
   
Example parameters: Epsilon = 0.5, MinPoints = 5

Its harder because there way too many points and its clustered all over the place. 


Coordinates transformation for better visualization - 

Axes:

The x-axis is on a linear scale, representing the independent variable (e.g., time or some parameter).
The y-axis is on a logarithmic scale, representing the dependent variable (e.g., exponential growth or decay).

Initial Linear Phase:

In the beginning, the curves appear linear on the logarithmic y-scale, suggesting exponential growth or decay (since exponential growth appears linear on a semi-log plot).

Second Non-Linear Phase:

The curves plateau, indicating a deviation from exponential behavior. This phase could represent logistic growth or saturation, where the growth rate slows as the dependent variable approaches a limit.

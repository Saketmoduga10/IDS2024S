1. Observational data is what we measure or record, which might contain errors or biases, while reality (truth) is the actual state of the world.
2. Aesthetics are visual elements that represent data like position, color, shape, size, and line type.
3. The first color palette is more appropriate for effective visualization communication because it has a greater contrast between colors which makes it easier for humans to differentiate between data categories.
   
4.
a) Qualitative Scales - 
Okabe Ito, ColorBrewer Dark2, ggplot2 hue:
Used for categorical data to differentiate discrete groups with visually distinct colors.

b) Sequential Scales - 
ColorBrewer Blues, Heat, Viridis:
Used for ordered or continuous data, representing progression in intensity or magnitude.

c) Diverging Scales - 
CARTO Earth, ColorBrewer PiYG, Blue-Red:
Used for data with a meaningful midpoint, showing divergence above and below a central value 

d) Accent Scales
Okabe Ito Accent, Grays with accents, ColorBrewer Accent - 
Used to highlight key features or emphasize certain data points in visualization.

5. 

 Valid: Inhaling and exhaling define breathing, so they are equivalent.
 Valid: The biconditional holds since breathing always involves inhaling and exhaling.
 Invalid: Being conscious doesn‚Äôt always imply breathing (e.g., artificial ventilation).
 Invalid: Consciousness doesn‚Äôt define breathing; they are related but not equivalent.
 Invalid: Rain doesn‚Äôt always imply cloudiness (e.g., rain from fog or unique weather conditions).
 Invalid: Rain is usually accompanied by clouds, but it‚Äôs not strictly equivalent.

6. Theory, Experiment, Computation.
7. No, logical implication is not the same as physical causation. Logical implication means that if one statement is true, another must also be true, based purely on reasoning. Physical causation requires a direct cause-effect relationship in the real world. Logical implication - "If it is raining, the ground is wet." (True based on reasoning, but doesn't explain how rain causes wet ground.) Physical causation - "Rain causes the ground to be wet because water falls and saturates the soil."

8. 
   1. No, it‚Äôs not a good fit. The red line oversimplifies the variability and trends in the data which ignores fluctuations and nonlinear behavior.
   2. Measurement uncertainty dominates. As older data relied on limited technology and inconsistent recording methods.
   3. Yes, it‚Äôs timeseries data because it represents temperature anomalies recorded over time with sequential timestamps.
   4. The rise could be because of industrialization and greenhouse gas emissions.

9. No, probability is generally a value between 0 and 1 and it is represented using real numbers or fractions and not integers.

10.    
Non-negativity: P(A) ‚â• 0.
Normalization: P (universe) = 1.
Additivity: P (A‚à™B) = P(A) + P(B), if A & B are disjoint.

11. 1 - 1 in decimal.
    01 - 1 in decimal.
    10 - 2 in decimal.
12. Not really. Real numbers are approximated using floating-point representations which have finite precision so they cannot represent all real numbers

14.  Git is a version control system for tracking code changes & GitHub is a platform for hosting Git repositories online.
15.  Bayesian probability
16.  Bayesian probability
17.  Frequentist probability because it requires repeatable experiments which cannot be applied to metaphysical questions like God's existence.
18.  The chart doesn't clearly show the data distribution in a way that aligns with reality. The curve looks unnatural at the edges because it lacks proper truncation or reflection to handle boundaries. The label "wrong" on the plot adds unnecessary clutter without explaining the actual issue. The curve extends into negative ages, which is not possible and it is misleading.
19.  Computers use integers because they operate in binary and also because integers can be easily encoded and manipulated using binary arithmetic.
20. Fortran
21. Plankalk√ºl is the first high level programming languages but a lot of people say Fortran is too.
22. PIC BELOW
23. PIC BELOW
24. Deductive reasoning: Starts with general principles to derive specific conclusions. EX -  "All humans are mortal. Socrates is human. Therefore, Socrates is mortal." Inductive reasoning: Draws general conclusions from specific observations. EX -  "The sun has risen every day so far. Therefore, it will rise tomorrow."
25. If two Boolean propositions are equal, they produce the same truth value for every possible combination of inputs. This means they are logically equivalent.
26. PIC BELOW
27. The symbol ‚à£ represents conditional probability, meaning the probability of ùê¥ given that both ùêµ and ùëà are true. It reflects how the presence of conditions ùêµ and ùëà affects the likelihood of ùê¥.
28. The summation S = 3 + 6 + 9 + ... + 99 is an arithmetic series with:
 First term (ùëé) = 3
 Common difference (ùëë) = 3
 Number of terms (ùëõ) = 33
S = n/2 x (a+l)
*S = 1683*

29. PIC BELOW
30. PIC BELOW
31. PIC BELOW
32. Types of fundamental uncertaintys are aleatory, epistemic and ontological uncertainty. Aleatory uncertainty is intrinsic because it represents inherent randomness or variability in natural systems that cannot be eliminated

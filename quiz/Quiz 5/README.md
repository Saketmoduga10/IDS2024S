1. π(A|B) represents the probability of event A given that event B has occurred. It is read as The probability of A given B.

2.
     1. Classical (based on symmetry and equally likely outcomes)
     2. Frequentist (relative frequency of occurrence)
     3. Bayesian (degree of belief or subjective probability)
     4. Axiomatic (Kolmogorov's set-theoretic foundation)

3. Bayesian school of thought

4. Frequentist school of thought

5. Bayesian probability allows defining it since it can represent subjective belief or degree of certainty

6. No, Bayesian inference is not a subset of Frequentist inference because they are distinct methodologies with different philosophical bases.

7. Bayesian inference.

8. Bayesian probability is more popular in physics and engineering because it is applicability to single and non-repeatable experiments. Frequentist theory is more used in biology and social sciences where repeated experiments and long-run frequencies are common

9. The first modern definition appeared in the 17th century with Pascal and Fermat

10. Aleatory uncertainty & Epistemic uncertainty

11. It is epistemic uncertainty beacuse you are misidentifying the donkey as a horse

12. Aesthetics is the visual properties of data representation. EX: color, size, shape, and position.

13. Positional & Non-positional

14. Factors are categorical variable & Levels are categories within a factor

15.  Numerical & Categorical

16.  Attributes

17.  Ordered: Age groups, Unordered: Hair color

18.
        1. Sequential: For ordered data EX: Temperature
        2. Diverging: For highlighting deviations  EX: profit vs. loss
        3. Categorical: For distinct categories  EX: regions
        4. Perceptually uniform: For clarity across ranges
   
19. 3D plots can mislead by distorting perception and are harder to interpret accurately.

20. "Age" could be Numerical (EX: 25 years) or Categorical (EX: child, adult, senior)

21. It is both

22. I think the Black graph could be best be used to represent data

23. I think the Top Pallete is more appropriate for effective visualization communications with humans.

24.
    1. Least varying temperature: San Diego
    2. Wildest varying temperature: Chicago
    3. Hottest in January: Death Valley
    4. Coolest in July: San Diego

  25. 

a)
Okabe Ito: Categorical (Colorblind-friendly).
ColorBrewer Dark2: Categorical.
ggplot2 hue: Categorical.

b)
ColorBrewer Blues: Sequential.
Heat: Sequential.
Viridis: Sequential (Perceptually uniform).

c)
CARTO Earth: Sequential.
ColorBrewer PiYG: Diverging.
Blue-Red: Diverging.

d)
Okabe Ito Accent: Categorical.
Grays with accents: Categorical with focus on contrast.
ColorBrewer Accent: Categorical.

26. A data set that is best visualized in polar coordinates is one that has circularity, periodicity, or radial symmetry

27. The color scale that has been used in the following visulization is categorical
 
28. The labels are difficult to read and could be better displayed horizontally or with a clearer font size and alignment. The orange "ugly" text adds no value and is distracting. The graph lacks a proper title or description, making it unclear what the data represents. The light blue bars lack contrast and could be more visually distinct.

29.

 a. I think the  Earth's temperature will likely increase in the following decades.

 b. By 2050, I think that the Earth's temperature will be approximately 2°C hotter than the average temperatures during 1951-1980.

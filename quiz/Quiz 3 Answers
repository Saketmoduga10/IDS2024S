1. Steps in Scientific Inference:
   1. Observation: Collecting data and identifying patterns.
   2. Hypothesis Formation: Developing a model or explanation.
   3. Prediction: Making predictions based on the model.
   4. Experimentation: Testing predictions through experiments.
   5. Validation/Refinement: Comparing results with predictions.

2. Three Pillars of Science: Theory, Experiment, Computation.

3. Applications of the Third Pillar:
   1. Weather Forecasting: Using models and simulations to replace complex, labor-intensive observations and theories.
   2. Bioinformatics: Computational methods replacing experiments for biological analysis.
   3. Financial Modeling: Simulations and predictions replacing purely theoretical analysis and experiments.

4. Categories of Logical Reasoning:
   1. Inductive Reasoning: (EX. observing that apples fall and concluding gravity affects them).
   2. Deductive Reasoning: (EX. all humans are mortal; Socrates is human; therefore, Socrates is mortal).

5. Data represents measurements or evidence, while reality is the actual state of the world. We cannot observe reality directly but we can observe data representing aspects of reality.

6. Model Validation vs. Calibration:
   1. Validation: Ensuring the model accurately predicts reality.
   2. Calibration: Adjusting the model parameters to fit the observed data.

7. Logical implication does not imply causation. EX. "If it rains, the ground is wet". This is an implication but it doesnt mean rain causes every instance of wet ground.

8. George Boole.

9. Represented by the overlapping area of two circles A and B.

10. Represented by the combined area of both circles A and B, including overlaps.

11. Two Boolean propositions are equal if they always have the same truth value.

12. Equals `True`. EX: A + ¬A is always true.

13. Equals `False`. EX: A ⋅ ¬A is always false.

14. Circle A is fully inside circle B. If A is true, B must be true.

15. Bit.

16. No information exists if there are no elements or states to describe.

17. Can represent `2^4 = 16` different integers.

18. Can represent `3^4 = 81` different possibilities.
